    <h2>Recipe</h2>

        down on the whole pack of these puppies once you see and smell the finished

    <p>Back when I was in elementary school, my mom would make one of these
        bad boys for me every day after school. That's how I got the nickname "Chili Boy"
        in the neighborhood. Looking back, that may have been why I didn't have many
        friends growing up and why I ballooned up to 200 lbs as a 12 year old, but on to
        the recipe...
